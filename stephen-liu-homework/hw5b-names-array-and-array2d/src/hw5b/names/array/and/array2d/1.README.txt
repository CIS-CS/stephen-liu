Arrays are objects.
Arrays can store primitives or objects.
Each element in the array must be of the same type.
Array indices always begin at zero.

Five things to do to set up an array:
1. specify a name.
2. specify the type.
3. create the array object.
4. set the dimension.
5. initialize the elements (contents)

FindSmallest.java
    This class contains a main() method so you can run it as a Java application.
    The application uses a for loop to find the smallest value in an array of
    integers.
    Exercises:
    1. Change the values in the array to test the application.
    2. Make it return the largest value.
    3. Replace the while loop with a for loop.
    4. Create a new class called FindMinMax.
       array data should be defined as a field, ie, outside main.
       add two methods, findMin() and findMax()

NamesArray.java
    This class contains a main() method so you can run it as a Java application.
    The application prompts the user for five names (Strings).
    It stores the names in an array of Strings, and then displays the 3rd
    and 5th name from the array.
    Exercises:
    1. Increase the size of the array and prompt the user for more
       names; display all the names; display the first and last name.
    2. Prompt the user for the number of names they want to enter.
       Create the array object (at runtime) to hold the names.
       Prompt user to enter the specified number of names.
       Display all the names.

Array2D.java
    Shows how to initialize a 2D array using a nested for loop.
    Exercises:
    1. Initialize the 2D array with values 1-50.
    2. Display the values in reverse order.

PassMark.java
    Uses two 1D arrays, one for students, one for scores.
    Removes students that do not have a passing grade.

These two classes are from the Java Tutorial on arrays.
Java Tutorial > Learning the Java Language > Language Basics > Variables > Arrays

ArrayDemo.java
    Creates a variable of type int[].
    Creates an array object.
    Stores values in the array.
    Displays the contents of the array.

MultiDimArrayDemo.java
    A 2D array is an array of arrays.
    Note how the 2D array object is created and initialized in a single
    statement.
    To access an element, you need to include both indexes, names[][].
    Using a single index will reference a single row of the array.
    Although you cannot change the size of 1D array, you can change the 
    dimensions of a 2D array.

    Exercises:
    1. Add another "row" to the "names" array for title, eq, PhD. MD, DDS, MsCS.
       Display some names with title.

    2. Study the code carefully.
       What is the shape of the int[][] array after Loop 1?
       Change the dimensions of 2D array so it is an "upside-down staircase."

    3. Initialize the 2D array to 1 through n.
       Display the contents of the 2D array in reverse order.
